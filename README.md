I would like to inform you that there is an issue with the visibility of the "SaaS" and "Self-Hosted" buttons. While the buttons are not visible, they remain fully functional. If you move the mouse over the area where the buttons should be, they will still perform as expected. This is a temporary issue, and I am working on fixing it.
